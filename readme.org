* Lox compiler in Python
This Lox compiler is an implementation of the book [[https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters]["Crafting Interpreters"]] from [[https://github.com/munificent][Bob Nystrom]].
It is not delivered as a complete package to let you play with it as you like. 

** Requirements
The code uses Python 3.6 and was developed on OS X. It should work quite easily on Windows.

** How to run the lox compiler
1. You can run the REPL with "python3 -m lox.lox" once you are in the pylox folder (top folder). You can exit the REPL with 'exit'.
2. You can run any test file (extension does not matter) as "python3 -m test.test_lox testfiles/$file", placing the file in "test/testfiles" folder.

** What is implemented on top of the book (in the /Challenges/ section)
1. 'break' statement is implemented.
2. Closures are implemented.
3. Lambdas are implemented (lambdas are supposed to be anonymous function here).
